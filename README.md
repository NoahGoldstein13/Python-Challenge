# Python-Challenge Homework Explanation

## Background - PyBank

I developed Python code to look at rows of data displaying profits / losses by month and develop thorough analysis of the data.

## Tools and Technologies Used for PyBank analysis

* Excel
* Python

## Data Source
Provided CSV holding profit and loss financial data.

## How to Run the Project
1. Save the resource file in a folder called "Resources"
2. Save python code to a ".py" file
3. Save a blank text file called "pybank_analysis.txt" file in an "analysis" folder
3. In your terminal, run the python file
4. You will now see the correct analysis print in your terminal and the analysis text file will also be populated with the outcome.
